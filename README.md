# Nicholas-AI
Want a chatbot that is Open-Source, Quick, Concise and No Logs? Check out this A.I. The A.I built for privacy. Built for Libre.

# HOW TO USE
Simply download this raw to your computer, and run the HTML which will run locally on your computer.

# OR
Copy the code and paste it to VSCode. Afterward, do the key combination of Ctrl + F5 (Or Fn + Ctrl + F5) and it will run locally on your PC.
# NOTE 
This chatbot will specifically not send logs to me or Gemini. But keep in mind that it was built by a nerdy 13 y/o. So please don't get mad if I didn't think of features
you liked in ChatGPT or DeepSeek. Instead. Issue me it and i'll add it as quick as possible.

# NOTE 2
Github will say it is HTML only. Don't be fooled. For the best ease-of-use, I compiled it to one file. Ask if you want specifically the CSS or Javascript.
